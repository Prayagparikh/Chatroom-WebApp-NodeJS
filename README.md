# node-chat-app

This is a very beautiful looking and user-friendly Chatroom application build using Node.js and frontend in HTML/CSS.

## To run in terminal(cmd)
1. npm install
2. npm run start
3. Locate to http://localhost:3000 (or whichever port number mentioned or available)

## Uniqueness
1. It works really well even if many number of people have joined the same room or different rooms.
2. Allows users to send there **Current Geolocation using GPS** (Just by allowing 'Know your Location')
3. **It discards any bad words in English language. A npm library called 'bad-words' have been used to identify a large list of bad words and will not broadcast any messages that contains it to any of the users.**
